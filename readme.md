# Cryptocurrency Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project performs an analysis of cryptocurrency price data from the FTX exchange for 10 major cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL, BAT, XRP, YFI, CREAM, TRX, DAI and USDT. The analysis was conducted in Power BI and aims to identify patterns, trends and relationships in cryptocurrency prices over time. Additional data was incorporated to develop an investment strategy proposal based on client risk profile and cryptocurrency volatility. 

Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Sklearn are used to import, process and visualize the data for presentation purposes.
